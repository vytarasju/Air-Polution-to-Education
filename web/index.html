            <h2>A bit more in depth...</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the correlation of Air Quality to various factors of Education Quality. <br><br>

                Negative correlation means, that Air Quality values are smaller with other comparable feature values getting higher. 
                Hence we ultimately would like to see negative correlation, to understand what education factors are driving values, 
                such as PM2.5 - lower. <br><br>

                If we consider just education, we see that it does in fact contribute to less air pollution, however I believe, that
                this is not a definitive conclusion to this topic. I have noticed trends, which are suggesting, that broader factors
                are more impactful. For instance, the features which have absolute value more than 40% have a lot of features including
                higher female achievements in education fields (such as secondary education teachers(% female), school enrollment secondary 
                female % gross). If we take a look at absolute value more than 30% of correlation, we see a lot of features, which have
                positive correlation to air pollution (meaning air pollution tends to increase when these features are also with higher
                values) - these features are often related to population distribution and life expectancy (Population ages 0-14, Number
                of deaths age 5-9 years). <br><br>
                
                What these factors tell me, is that criterias, which define the development stage of a country are most impactful.
                Consider an image at the end of this webpage - age distribution of a population: developed versus underdeveloped
                country. Generally underdeveloped countries have higher distribution of population within young people. Also consider
                lower life expectancy, less avaliability for education, gender issues, less education opportunities for women... Many
                of these factors are related to development of a country. <br><br>

                Hence the conclusion that I developed after this project, is that air pollution is definitely correlated to education,
                however - the bigger issue at hand, is in fact the overall development of a country - not strictly education. Stating,
                that air quality is bad, because people are not educated means pointing fingers at a general population, who are - 
                generaly speaking, a consequence of a general state of development in a country.
